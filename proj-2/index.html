    <h1>Thoughts On Readings </h1>
READING 1: <br>
Seeing Maya’s old instagram feed deeply reminded me of how social media looked initially, specifically on instagram and vine. People both of considerable and minimal status were learning their own ways of taking up space online, the juvenile approach putting everyone on a level pedestal. Funny faces and filters were popular, and everyone participated in trends that could now be considered “cringe” . As a 10-year-old kid on Vine, I noticed the difference in the way men and women positioned themselves within the 6-second time limit. Posed and more “presentable” than their male counterparts. I would imitate these poses and mannerisms in the mirror, even opening the camera app on my iphone to put my mimicry skills to the test. I can see myself learning to perform, looking back. Maya’s personal shift in perspective in performance really resonated with me because I feel the exact same. At one point I realized that there are so many facets to myself that I can put on, and that slowly building a page that builds itself can be a really enjoyable experience. To me, my online presence is a collage of my identity. It reflects many parts of myself that I cannot express at once. <br>

“These limitations and autonomous processes compel users to process the white neutrality of the screen and anti-blackness of technology uncritically because it is so easy and efficient to use. In “ The concepts discussed in Black Gooey Universe were deeply intriguing as a user, not a programmer. I really appreciated that the author took time to explain industry-specific jargon, especially because it was integral to the argument and analyses made. The metaphor of the transition from a black screen to white reminded me of a gallery I visited last year in Culver City by Sekou Cooke. The gallery displayed architecture in Los Angeles as a reflection of hip-hop, with explorations that further prove how black culture stands as the fabric of endless faces of contemporary culture. The exhibit also interrogated the way that hip-hop lives in architecture and how the practice was developed in a matter that ultimately erased it’s culture from architecture, similar in the way that Black Gooey did. Admittedly, some of the vocabulary in the article was hard to digest in my initial reads, and it took me some time to break it down. It truly is astounding to learn more and more about the anti-blackness in America and just how deep-rooted it can get. Personal computers are now an extension of ourselves in our day-to-day, and this article forces users to sit and look at their devices in a more critical manner. <br>

Sydette Harry’s article was heavy and powerful. I appreciated the attention to pop culture and how the “facilitators” of it are almost always deeply ignorant, in a manner that is disheartingly blatant. There is a very prominent lack of education, and the predominance of ignorance is laid out clearly. This article was my introduction to sousveillance. I do think I could use more reading into sousveillance, but Harry’s article was a strong beginning. It is interesting to note the prevailing power structures that lie in sousveillance; while it could be assumed that it benefits those who are endangered by authority, it demands that black bodies continuously submit to being observed and documented. They are not believed; and the documentation of their suffering is necessary for others to understand and take their traumatic experience. This form of surveillance immortalizes the suffering of black bodies, allowing anyone to engage in an almost sadistic form of voyeurism. <br>

Winnie Soon's Unerasable Characters ||| was a smartly done piece of work. I always appreciate the insertion of data in creative works, and it pairs synergetically. Censorship is a really nuanced topic and Soon approached it with great care. One thing I found interesting to see was that the censored archives were kept censored. They continue to stay silenced. The aural choice to have no audio paired really sets it in. There is nothing to hide in, and the viewer is painfully aware of all the unheard statements. The punctuation, and emojis which indicate the tone, give us an idea of what there was, but there will never be true transparency. Especially during such a visceral time, these were messages sent out with thoughts that were more scattered, heavy, and pensive. These where messages that needed to be heard. <br>

 Joy Buolamwini’s talk “How I'm fighting bias in algorithms” was another reminder of the importance of putting diverse bodies at the forefront of our leading facets of society. Although not algorithmic, there are problems in other industries that stem from lack of inclusivity. Safety tests for car crashes are barely beginning to use crash dummies that look like women, finally addressing a disproportionate amount of injuries suffered by women in accidents. Kodak film was criticized by companies for developing brown tones in products inaccurately, which was revealed to be because the development process was configured to favor white skin. Algorithms are learning entities, created by us, and it is important that as creators/coders that we diversify what our algorithms interact with. Joy’s quote when talking about employing inclusive practices deeply resonated, “We’ve used tools of computational creation to unlock immense wealth. We now have the opportunity to unlock even greater equality if we make social change a priority and not an afterthought.” Machine learning is expansive and exciting, but if we reprioritize our approach to learn from all faces, it opens this medium to much more complex and intriguing work. <br>

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Tedtalk was one that I have watched before and has struck deeply and stuck. Her anecdotes of experiencing the consequences of the single story and how she also has unintentionally perpetuated it resonated profoundly. I have heard the same story/stories that she has. I would like to acknowledge and commend how she discussed the dangers of it with such care. Adichie is a magnetic storyteller, and her talk laid it out clearly: as creators and consumers, we must not allow anyones identity or personhood be reduced to “one story”. As we begin to open ourselves up to media, the framework is set. The stories presented to us, the stories we consume, become what we know of our world and the worlds of others. While synonymous with the phrase “cultural melting pot”, the west is known to systemically misconstrue the representation of marginalized voices. We must make a conscious effort to deconstruct stereotypes and inform ourselves of real stories that reflect real people. <br>

Christine Sun Kim’s ted talk was definitely one that I would joyfully watch again. Despite being only 15 minutes, she was able to smartly and beautifully propose such a wonderful sentiment. One of the things mentioned, this tie between language and social currency, is very interesting. As someone who speaks two languages, this is something I heard often growing up; I was sure to get ahead in any industry, given that this skill I possessed would allow me to connect to more people. I do agree with the idea that because ASL does not produce any aural input/output, its social currency is stunted. In high school I saw many of my peers opt for ASL for the language requirement, but doing so with the mentality that it was an easy alternative as opposed to the “harder”, “real” languages. Many saw it as a novelty, leaving class loosely signing their names and discarding the rest of the material. The way that Kim proposed sign in alignment with music was well said and deeply intriguing. The movements reminded me of how a theremin is played, an instrument that creates noise triggered by the players body within an electromagnetic field. The player never makes physical contact with the theremin, but rather moves and contorts their arms/hands on different axis to mess with the pitch and volume. <br>
